# What-I-do

I am someone who likes to code and hack in their free time. I pentest and use offensive techniques to find or make malicious code in systems. 

!!!IMPORTANT NOTE!!

Everything i do is (somewhat) legal and i do not condone any form of ilegal offensive hacking, no matter how captivating it might be. Use my code at your own risk. all liability falls to the user on how they use this code. some of it might be ass, some of it might be great. my code is a bag of goodies waiting to be slurped up by any unforntunate system.
